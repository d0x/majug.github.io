### Termin

Der Vortrag findet am 02.09.2010 um 19:00 Uhr in der Uni Mannheim A5, 6 im Raum C013 statt [Anfahrtsbeschreibung](/getting-there).

### Abstract

Slides are available on Slideshare: [http://slidesha.re/dc62D4](http://slidesha.re/dc62D4)

Git is a distributed SCM, which means every contributor has a full local copy of the complete history of every revision of the project, allowing for independence and unparalleled speed compared to other centralized SCMs. With Git's intelligent branching and merging functionality, combined with a highly optimized network transport protocol, distributed development becomes much more efficient.

Contributors who don't have direct write access to the main repository of an open source project benefit from the distributed nature of Git, as they can still take advantage of the same tools that committers have. This explains the high interest of open source projects to favor Git over traditional versioning systems like CVS or SVN, in order to ease the life of all contributors, and make the community more productive.

Git is the future of SCM at Eclipse. The EGit project is implementing Eclipse tooling on top of JGit, the Java implementation of Git. Both EGit and JGit moved to Eclipse in May 2009 and shipped with Helios in June 2010.

This talk will give an update on the project progress and more detailed information about the design and features. A demo will illustrate how it's used in its own development process. It will also show how Gerrit Code Review, a JGit based review system developed for the needs of the Android community, can help to further improve the development process.

The talk will be in German.

### Bio

Matthias Sohn works at SAP since 1999 in various positions in the area of technology development and holds a PHD in experimental physics of the University of Karlsruhe (now KIT). He has a focus on development infrastructure, especially versioning systems but also build systems, component models and development processes. Since 2009 Matthias is initial committer for the Eclipse projects JGit and EGit and since February 2010 co-project lead for EGit. He is in close contact with the Maven / Tycho community and right now starts contributing to Gerrit Code Review. Besides that he tries to help the SAP development organization to learn from successful Open Source projects. In his spare time he enjoys his family and passionately plays the double bass.

Dr. Stefan Lay has been developing java applications for 10 years and joined SAP at the beginning of 2005. He holds a PhD in theoretical physics of the University of Freiburg.
Currently Stefan is working in the java infrastructure department of SAP with a focus on the eclipse integration of versioning systems. Since 2009 Stefan is initial committer for the Eclipse projects EGit and JGit. At SAP he additionally acts as a scrum master of the project which contributes to EGit, JGit and Gerrit.
In his spare time Stefan enjoys his family, cycling, reading and in the near future renovating his new house.
