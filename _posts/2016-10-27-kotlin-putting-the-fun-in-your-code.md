### Abstract

In this talk we take a look at the Kotlin Programming Language. Based on a sample application, we will go over the language features and see how they compare to Java. We will discuss the interoperability between both languages and see how to build Kotlin applications using Gradle.

### Bio

Alexander Hanschke works at techdev Solutions and is helping clients to realize IT projects mostly based on Java. He resisted to jump at a new language for a long time, but eventually fell in love with Kotlin.
