### Language

The talk will be given in English.

### Termin

Der Vortrag findet am 21.07.2016 um 19:00 Uhr in der Uni Mannheim A5, 6 im Raum C013 statt ([Anfahrtsbeschreibung](/getting-there)).

### Abstract

A lot of people refer to Java 8 as a shift towards functional programming. But what exactly does this mean? What are the benefits from using functions and lambdas? What ideas do `Stream`s, `Optional`s and `CompletableFuture`s share? And how can one exploit these? In this talk we try to give a comprehensive answer by introducing the basics of functional programming and providing a lot of real world examples in Java 8. Further, we will also have a look on how lambda expressions are translated to bytecode and, whether, there is a perfomance impact.

After this talk you will

- know how functions are represented in Java 8 
- know the common abstractions of `Stream`s, `Optional`s and `CompleteableFuture`s
- hopefully apply some of the given suggestions
