### Abstract

Java's most ubiquitous library is getting an update!
And this is the time to see what's new and weigh in on its course.

This talk will...

* show you how to write tests with JUnit 5
* walk you through the changes compared to JUnit 4
* expand on dynamic tests and the extension model
* present the new architecture
* discuss compatibility with previous JUnit versions, IDEs, and other
testing tools

Be careful, though:
You might end up with an urge to start using it right away.
