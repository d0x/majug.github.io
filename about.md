<p class="message">
  The majug² was founded in 2008 and offers regular talks on Java-related topics about once a month. Every now and then we hold a CodeCamp to hone our coding skills and get to know a new technology.
  The meetings are usually held at the Mannheim University, after the talk, we have drinks and socialize in a nearby pub. Members come from all around Mannheim from an area which stretches from Karlsruhe to Walldorf, Darmstadt, and Frankfurt.
